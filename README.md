Welcome to the National Biomedical Image Archive Project!
================================================================

The National Biomedical Imaging Archive (NBIA) is a free and open source service and software application that enables users to securely store, search, and download diagnostic medical images, providing a searchable national repository integrating in vivo cancer images with clinical and genomic data. Using role-based security, NBIA provides web-based access to de-identified DICOM images, image markup, annotations, and rich meta data. The NBIA download package is a ZIP package that includes the NBIA application, supporting libraries, the RSNA MIRC application (with NBIA modifications), documentation, and a sample NBIA database. A web-based visualization and annotation tool, I-Response, is available to users of the NCI NBIA instance.

Along with the Clinical Trial Processor software from the Radiological Society of North America, NBIA supports customized de-identification of images. NBIA is able to integrate with other imaging applications to cull various data types, such as image annotations, clinical data, genomic data, and other research files, such as RT objects.NBIA can also federate with other instances of NBIA to support the response of multiple NBIA servers to a single query.

NCI's hosted instance of NBIA is freely available and provides researchers and clinicians with a robust DICOM archive that can securely share and access images to enhance scientific research and support clinical decision making. Anyone can deploy a local node of NBIA and, using caGrid infrastructure, securely share data across the grid.

The ultimate goals of the project include:
 * Creation of an imaging informatics infrastructure that provides cost-effective support for purpose-built and other databases as necessary, precluding the need to create separate infrastructure for each database;
 * Development of searchable imaging reference libraries linked to clinical outcomes data to assist researchers and practitioners;
 * Availability of the archive for mining and integration by the broader research and clinical community; and
 * Robust support for data-driven decision making in oncology and medical practice in general by clinicians throughout the world.
